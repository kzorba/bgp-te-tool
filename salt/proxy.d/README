From salt documentation:

"You can configure static grains for Proxy Minions. As multiple Proxy Minion 
processes can run on the same machine, you need to index the files using the 
Minion ID, under /etc/salt/proxy.d/<minion ID>/grains. For example, the grains 
for the Proxy Minion router1 can be defined under 
/etc/salt/proxy.d/router1/grains, while the grains for the Proxy Minion switch7
can be put in /etc/salt/proxy.d/switch7/grains."

In our case, since each proxy minion is in a dedicated docker container, we can 
define its custom grains in this hierarchy and uncomment the line 

#      - $PWD/salt/proxy.d/:/etc/salt/proxy.d/

in docker-compose.yml.
